# Refactoring Angular

## Part 1

Show a regular angular app with a:
- Global controller
- ngRoute
- Factory
- Index.html: Use ng-repeat to loop through an array of objects and add it to the DOM

In this part just show the code and then talk about what's wrong and why it needs to be refactored

## Part 2

Refactor into two custom Directives, removing the global Controller. Keep ngRoute and the Factory. Make sure to use isolate scope. Talk about why this is better code.

## Part 3

Using Angular 1.5.3 refactor into a component. Use the component router. Make sure to talk about push state. (You have to use it with the component router.) Make sure to turn HTML5 mode on. All a component is is a directive with isolated scope.
